# Buildstarter

Buildstarter is like Kickstarter, but for Open Source where the community funds features with cryptocurrency that that team should build. Anyone can propose a feature for a small registration fee by calling the method “register.” Features have a funding goal and funding deadline. Anyone can call “fund” and contribute toward the funding goal.

When the funding deadline passes, two possibilities exist:

* **Funding goal met or exceeded** – Anyone can call “settle” and transfer funds to the owner of the feature
* **Funding goal not met** – Anyone who contributed can call “refund” and get their funds back

With Buildstarter, Open Source teams don't need to worry about which features to focus on next and how to fund their development. The community will speak with its cryptowallet.
